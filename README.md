# Advent of Code

This is a collection of all the advent of code attempts I've done. Each year I use a different language that I've never used/don't have much experience with. The month of problems offers an excellent chance to learn a new programming language while also doing some fairly difficult brain teasers.

### 2024

I used AoC as a challenge to learn the ever popular JavaScript.
The solutions start off basic but get more organized and advanced as time goes by. I by no means am fluent in JavaScript but I can tell I made substantial progress over the course of the month.
